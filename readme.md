# Problem Statement (First Draft)
Restaurants may have passed their latest inspection and can be open for business with no problems, but this isn't the full story. More information should be provided to potential customers about the track record of the restaurant so they can make a better informed decision. The goals of this project are:

- A streamlit app which helps people assess the cleanliness of restaurants via visualizations of the restaurant's inspection statistics. This app could 
lower the severity of foodborne outbreaks by informing the customers of potential unsafe food practices of restaurants before they choose to eat there.
- A classification model to predict the inspection result. (logistic regression)

**Stretch Goals:**
The results of this project could be scaled to work for multiple cities as well as covering other types of establishments such as hotels, housing units, and even swimming pools. With my app I hope to encourage people to make more informed & healthier choices on things which may impact their health and well-being greatly.


**Initial Data Collection Research**

Two potential data sources
- Chicago Data Portal
- New York Data Portal

All cities/counties in the US provide ample data on restaurant inspection, with varying degrees of accessibility, ranging from needing to file a 'request for info' on a per restaurant basis, displaying the data already in json format on the website to be easily scraped or offering downloadable PDFs, to even having all the inspection results stored in a downloadble .csv file all ready to be worked upon. I begun my search considering only major cities as I want my app to have the highest impact possible upon release, and these cities also had more modern data storage techniques.

I narrowed my choices down to Chicago and New York as they came in .csv format with thorough data descriptions and were maintained the best. 

In the end I chose the Chicago dataset as its information is the perfect level of thoroughness without requiring too much cleaning and reorganization considering the limited timeframe of this capstone project. In the future steps of this project, I must explore how to to aggregate multiple cities restaurant inspection info through varied data collection methods in order to generalize this data for the purposes of scaling my app across many regions.




















Personal objectives for this project:

1. Mastery of data cleaning and feature engineering

2. A dive into app development and translating my data analysis into a front-end product that expresses my work in the most captivating way for the non-techincal audience.

3. In confronting the obstacles of this idea, understanding how I could solve them in the context of the bootcamp deadline while also keeping as thorough a record as possible for how I could solve these problems better in the future versions of this idea.
